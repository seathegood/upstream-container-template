# Creating a New Package Definition

This repository is designed to make upstream-based container images consistent and predictable. Follow the checklist below when onboarding a new package.

## 1. Copy the Skeleton
```
cp -R containers/_template containers/<package-name>
```
Rename files and references to match your package. Keep the directory name lowercase with dashes.

## 2. Describe the Upstream
Edit `containers/<package-name>/container.yaml`:
- `name`: human-readable identifier (e.g. `hive-metastore`).
- `upstream`: source project metadata (homepage, download URL, license).
- `version`: strategy for discovering new releases (manual, http-json, github, etc.).
- `runtime`: base image and runtime configuration.
- `tests`: list of smoke-test commands to run after builds.

If the upstream ships artifacts for multiple architectures, document how to fetch per-arch bundles.

## 3. Customize the Dockerfile
The `_template` Dockerfile uses snippets from `templates/docker/`. Swap snippets or add new ones when:
- The application is JVM-based and needs JAR installation.
- The upstream provides `.deb` or `.rpm` packages.
- Additional OS packages or configuration files are required.

Override files go under `containers/<package-name>/files/`. These are staged into the image during the build according to `container.yaml` instructions.

## 4. Wire Version Detection (Optional)
`./scripts/package.py detect-version <package>` prints the strategy and notes from `container.yaml`. Extend `scripts/package.py` with custom logic (HTTP calls, GitHub API, regex extraction) to auto-detect versions when possible. When automated detection is impossible, set `version.current` manually and update the `notes` field with the playbook for future maintainers.

## 5. Add Tests
Small smoke tests give confidence in CI:
- Bats, pytest, or shell scripts placed under `containers/<package-name>/tests/`.
- Compose scenarios (`docker-compose.yml`) for services needing dependencies (e.g. databases).

Declare each test in `container.yaml#tests`. The `make test PACKAGE=name` target executes them after building.

## 6. Document Run Instructions
Populate `containers/<package-name>/README.md` with:
- Summary of what the container runs.
- Environment variables, ports, volumes.
- Required secrets or TLS assets.
- Example `docker run` and `docker compose` usage.

## 7. Commit and Wire CI
Add CI matrix entries if the package should publish on release. Ensure secrets for publishing (e.g. registry credentials) exist in the repository or organization settings before enabling automatic pushes.

By following this playbook every container package stays well-documented, reproducible, and ready for automated maintenance.
